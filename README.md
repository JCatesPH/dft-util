Contains python scripts with functions meant to manipulate ASE Atoms objects to make calculations with VASP easier.
  
	Requirements: ase conda package (Atomic Simulation Environment) and its requirements.
  
AbiScripts:   
Tools to work with ABINIT input and output.
  
	Requirements: ase conda package (Atomic Simulation Environment), abipy, and their requirements.

QEScripts: 
Contains python scripts with functions meant to manipulate ASE Atoms objects to make calculations with Quantum Espresso easier.
