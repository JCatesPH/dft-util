# my-phys-util
A collection of scripts or code I write for physics research or learning purposes. Mostly about learning without a overarching scheme.

HeuslerScripts: 
Contains python scripts with functions meant to manipulate ASE Atoms objects to make calculations with VASP easier.
  
	Requirements: ase conda package (Atomic Simulation Environment) and its requirements.
  
AbiScripts:   
Tools to work with ABINIT input and output.
  
	Requirements: ase conda package (Atomic Simulation Environment), abipy, and their requirements.

QEScripts: 
Contains python scripts with functions meant to manipulate ASE Atoms objects to make calculations with Quantum Espresso easier.
  
	Requirements: ase conda package (Atomic Simulation Environment) and its requirements.
  
ZMCIntegral: 
Research work with another professor to compute Monte Carlo integration of multivariable functions using CUDA libaries. The package, ZMCIntegral can be found at https://github.com/Letianwu/ZMCintegral .
  
	Conda Requirements: numpy llvmlite numba cudatoolkit zmcintegral
